# AEM 6850: Empirical Methods for Applied Economists

Spring 2026

M/W 1:15-2:30 Location: Kohlberg 226

Office Hours: MW 12-1 and by appointment

TA: TBA

**Course objectives:** The course introduces students to basic practices and tools that will enhance your ability to conduct empirical research and analysis in microeconomics in a data-rich world. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in various data management, visualization and quantitative techniques necessary to efficiently conduct independent research. The course format is “hands-on” and students will conduct most of their work on their personal computers using python and VSCode.

The skills you learn may be applied to other languages and programming (such as in R and maybe even Stata).

**Pre-requisite:** EC 31

## **Expected outcomes:**

1.  Proficient in reproducible python programming
2.  Capable of gathering, manipulating and visualizing various types of data effectively for research purposes
3.  Capable of employing simulation and resampling methods in applied research

## **Grading:**

Students will be graded on class participation (10%), empirical exercises (40%) and final reproducible project (40%+10%). The “+10%” relates to the quality of each student’s review of other’s work.

## **Homework:**

Homework will be due a week after it is assigned. You will grade each other based on a simple rubric.

## Research Presentation

The largest part of your grade will be based on a research presentation that you will work on and present in front of class. You will be expected to use the tools you learned here and write up an analysis. A good research idea will include 2/3 components: 1. Tight visualizations 2. Data Analysis using regression, prediction 3. Extraction of interesting data from the web or other sources.

## Special Topic

The last lecture of the course will be a special topic that I will write up based on what students want. I will send out a poll to see which topic would be most interesting. Topics include, but are not limited to: 1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation/GMM 2. More machine learning 3. Google Earth API 4. Advanced web scraping with Selenium 5. Advanced LLMs

## Policies

Make-up exams will not be given unless you provide documented evidence of a circumstance that merits rescheduling (e.g., illness). If the conflict is known beforehand, you must make arrangements with me well before the exam date. Late problem sets will only be accepted with permission from me, will suffer a grade penalty, and will not be accepted once the solutions have been posted on Moodle. The problem set on which you receive the lowest score (including a zero) will be dropped.

If you believe you need accommodations for a disability or a chronic medical condition, please visit the Student Disability Services website for details about the accommodations process. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. You are also welcome to contact me privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance, through Student Disability Services.

Within this class, you are welcome to use foundation models in a totally unrestricted fashion, for any purpose, at no penalty. However, you should note that all large language models still have a tendency to make up incorrect facts and fake citations, or do math wrong. You will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit, regardless of whether it originally comes from you or a foundation model. If you use foundation models or LLMs, its contribution must be acknowledged; you will be penalized for using it without acknowledgment.

The university's policy on plagiarism still applies to any uncited or improperly cited use of work by other human beings, or submission of work by other human beings as your own.

## **Communication:**

Moodle will have the basic information on the course, such as the syllabus, and course calendar. But communication will take place on Slack. Slack is a great way to collaborate, ask questions and chat on relevant topics. If you have a question on the course, feel free to Slack me or the TA, and we'll answer as soon as possible. You should also use the platform as a way to communicate and work with each other to try to solve problems. Sign up for the slack channel here:

## **Course Materials:**

Course materials can be accessed on github. We will learn how to use GitHub in this course, but for now, you can go to the repository link (<https://github.com/amichuda/ec34-ds-for-econ>), click on the green "Code" button and click "Download Zip" to download all course materials. Note that if materials are updated, you will need to re-download. That's one of the reasons why learning Git is so useful.
